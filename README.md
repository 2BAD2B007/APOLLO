# BETA - FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY
* This is your warning. I've tested a few modules but there is much more testing to be done.
* Find a bug or a better query, let me know!
* Extra warning on PowerLog modules, timestamps may be in the past and/or future - testing these.
* Many more modules to come!

## Usage
`python apollo.py -output {csv, sql} <modules directyr> <data directory>`

## Output Options
* csv - CSV
* sql - SQLite Database

## Data Directory Pro Tip
* Extract databases as it will take forever (1hr+) to run on full disk dump, it works, but be patient.
